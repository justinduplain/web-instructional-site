# Web Design and Development Instructional Site

This site was created to teach my web design students about responsive web page design, media queries, floats, CSS interactivity, HTML5 forms, and HTML tables.

- 9/1/22: Updated to Sass

## Overview
- I Adapted the text assignment and website to include a more modern layout with a two and three-column framework.
- I provided detailed instructions for students on several topics:
  - [How to set up media queries and several breakpoints and work within a responsive CSS framework](https://pmentropy.github.io/web-instructional-site/student_instructions/media_query_instructions.html)
  - [How to add CSS interactivity and media files to pages](https://pmentropy.github.io/web-instructional-site/student_instructions/multimedia_and_css_interactivity_instructions.html)
  - [How to add forms and tables to responsive layouts](https://pmentropy.github.io/web-instructional-site/student_instructions/forms_and_tables_instructions.html)

The overall site concept was adapted by me and based on exercises from the textbook [Web Development & Design Foundations with HTML5 - 9th Edition](https://webdevfoundations.net/9e/index.html) by Terry Felke-Morris.
