# Responsive Gallery Site

This site was created to teach my web design students about responsive web page design, media queries, floats and some advanced HTML and CSS concepts. The overall site concept is based on the textbook (https://webdevfoundations.net/9e/index.html)[Web Development & Design Foundations with HTML5 (9th Edition)] by Terry Felke-Morris and adapted by me for using in my web design classes. 

##Overview
- Adapted the text assignment and website to include a more modern layout with a two and three-column framework.
- I provided detailed instructions for students on several topics:
  - How to set up media queries and several breakpoints, how to work within a responsive CSS framework
  - How to add CSS interactivity and media files to pages
  - How to add forms and tables to responsive layouts
